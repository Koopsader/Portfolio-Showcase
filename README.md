This is where all my tech demos are to showcase my game development skills

If you are playing Stick Brawlers or "StickFightSim", you need to be on Windows for it to run properly

The controls are as follows:
- WASD: Movement
- Space: Jump
- Left Shift: Dash
- Left Click: Attack
- Right Click: Block
- Q: Slide Kick
